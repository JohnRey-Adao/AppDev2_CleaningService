# WebStore (Angular)

This module will host the main customer-facing Angular application.

- Development: run from repo root: `run-frontend.bat webstore`
- Build: `cd webstore && npm run build`

Note: The existing Angular app currently lives in `frontend/`. We'll migrate it here in a follow-up step.
